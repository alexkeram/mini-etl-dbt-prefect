    "# Teaching with a teacher - model quality\n",
    "## 📌 Project goal\n",
    "To develop a model that predicts the probability of reducing the customer’s purchasing activity, and highlight segments for personalized marketing offers.  Link to the Hithab repository: https://github.com/alexkeram/teach-model\n",
    "## 🔹 Step 1. Data loading\n",
    "- Download all the files provided:\n",
    "  - `/Datasets/money.csv`\n",
    "- Make sure that the data correspond to the description.\n",
    "- Check the separators and correctly consider the tables (special attention on `Sep = ';'` `and` decimal = ',' `).\n",
    "## 🔹 Step 2. Data value\n",
    "- Check data types, passes, duplicates.\n",
    "- Transform numerical signs into the correct format (for example, with `Object` →` float`).\n",
    "- Delete or fill out missing values.\n",
    "- Conduct primary cleaning and, if necessary, transcode categorical values.\n",
    "## 🔹 Step 3. Research Analysis of Data (EDA)\n",
    "- Conduct visualization and descriptive analysis of the signs:\n",
    "  - Distributions,\n",
    "  - emissions,\n",
    "  - unique values ​​of categorical features.\n",
    "- identify customers having at least one purchase for the last 3 months.\n",
    "- Check the distribution of the target feature (`purchasing activity`).\n",
    "- identify potential correlations and anomalies.\n",
    "## 🔹 Step 4.\n",
    "- combine the tables by `id`, transforming:\n",
    "  - `market_money.csv` in width for the periods:` revenue_ket`, `revenue_fire`,` revenue_d_ now.\n",
    "  - `market_time.csv` in a similar width:` Time_ket`, `Time_field`,` Time_D_ This.\n",
    "- attach to `market_file.csv`.\n",
    "- Save the table `money.csv` with a profit separately (use later for segmentation).\n",
    "## 🔹 Step 5. Correlation analysis\n",
    "- Calculate the correlation matrix between numerical signs.\n",
    "- visualize the heat card.\n",
    "- if necessary - remove one of the strongly correlating signs (multicollinearity).\n",
    "## 🔹 Step 6. Building of models using soldiers\n",
    "### 6.1 Preparation of Paydain\n",
    "- Use `Columntransformer` for separate processing of signs:\n",
    "  - Categorical: `ONEHOTENCODER`,` ORDINALENCODER`\n",
    "  - Numerical: `StandardScaler`,` minmaxScaler`\n",
    "- Gather Piplaine based on `pipeline`.\n",
    "### 6.2 Model training\n",
    "Teach the following models with the selection of hyperparameters:\n",
    "- `logisticregression`\n",
    "- `decisiontreeclassifier`\n",
    "- `Kneighborsclassifier`\n",
    "- `svc`\n",
    "### 6.3 Selection of metric\n",
    "- The main metric: ** roc auc ** (due to the task of binary classification and possible imbalance of classes).\n",
    "- Use `RandomizedSearchcv` or` Gridsearchcv` with cross-native.\n",
    "## 🔹 Step 7. Model interpretation\n",
    "- Determine the best model by ROC AUC.\n",
    "- calculate the importance of signs for the best model.\n",
    "- Use the `Shap 'library to build a graph of importance.\n",
    "- Conclusion:\n",
    "  - what signs have had the greatest influence;\n",
    "  - which can be excluded;\n",
    "  - Business interpretation of the result.\n",
    "## 🔹 Step 8. Clients segmentationand recommendations\n",
    "### 8.1 segmentation\n",
    "- combine these models (probabilities of reducing activity) and `money.csv`.\n",
    "- Create segments (approximately 2-3 segments) by:\n",
    "  - profit,\n",
    "  - share of promotional purchases,\n",
    "  - Categories of goods,\n",
    "  - probabilities of reducing activity.\n",
    "### 8.2 segment analysis\n",
    "- visualize the distributions and signs of the selected segment.\n",
    "- Describe business characteristics.\n",
    "- Make proposals to keep activity:\n",
    "  - Changing the conditions of mailings,\n",
    "  - New promotions,\n",
    "  - personalized proposals.\n",
    "### 8.3 Cods on segments\n",
    "- What segment is chosen.\n",
    "- What measures are proposed.\n",
    "- Why is it important for business.\n",
    "## 🔹 Step 9. General conclusion\n",
    "- Briefly describe:\n",
    "  - The task,\n",
    "  - initial data and sources,\n",
    "  - Stages of expense,\n",
    "  - Model training and results,\n",
    "  - the selected model and metric,\n",
    "  - interpretation of signs,\n",
    "  - segmentation and business recommendations."

    "- the `market_time.csv` table is transformed similarly to the columns:` Time_te`, `Time_field`. A sign of `time_d_e is absent in the source data.\n",
    "- All transformed tables are combined with the main (`market_file.csv`) by the key` id`. The size of the final table: 1300 lines and 18 signs.\n",

    "- ** communications: ** less often agree to mailings, receive less marketing touches.\n",
    "- ** User behavior: ** Viewing fewer pages and categories, spend less time on the site.\n",
    "- ** Promotions and purchases: ** Make fewer promotional purchases, less goods are left in the basket.\n",
    "- ** financial indicators: ** they have below revenue in each of the three months.\n",
    "- ** Categories of interests: ** more often buy cosmetics and dishes; Less commonly - goods for children and equipment.\n",
    "- ** Type of service: ** Among them, the tariff `standard` is more common.\n",
    "Thus, customers with reduced activity demonstrate signs of reducing involvement and less loyalty to the store. These behavioral features can be used to build a model and subsequent segmentation."

    "In the previous stages, we studied the behavior of customers who have reduced activity and determined the key features affecting the outflow: low involvement on the site, orientation on stocks, a smaller volume of revenue.\n",
    "Now, on the basis of the model and probabilities of reducing activity, we will single out specific customer groups for further analysis and personalized actions. The task is to determine which segments are most important to retain or require attention from the point of view of marketing.\n",
    "#### Logic selection selection\n",
    "I decided to consider ** three segments **, each of which has business significance:\n",
    "- ** segment a: **\n",
    "  Clients with a high probability of reducing activity ** and at the same time ** high profit **.\n",
    "  This is a key group for priority retention - the loss of these customers will be the most painful for business.\n",
    "- ** segment b: **\n",
    "  Clients with ** high share of promotional purchases ** and ** average profit **.\n",
    "  The risk of forming dependence on discounts and, as a result, a decrease in marginality is possible. The segment is important for rethinking marketing strategies.\n",
    "- ** segment C: **\n",
    "  Customers buying ** goods for children **, and at the same time having ** increased risk of outflow **.\n",
    "  The possible sign that in the “Products for Children” category there are problems with interest/retention, despite the importance of this audience (for example, young families).\n",
    "#### Why are the three segments chosen\n",
    "During segmentation, we do not just share users, but select groups with different business risks and behavioral patterns:\n",
    "- ** The A ** segment covers customers whose loss is the most critical due to high profit.\n",
    "- ** segment b ** allows you to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing and identify customers prone to discounts.\n",
    "- ** The C ** segment is important for analysis of behavior in a particular product category with potential risk.\n",

    "### conclusion by step 8: Customer segmentation and recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "** Selected segment: **  \n",
    "The analysis was carried out for ** segment A ** - customers with high profit (> 4.0) and a high probability of outflow (> 0.7). This segment includes ** 186 users **, which is more than 12% of the entire base and gives the greatest contribution to the revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Dynamics of revenue: **\n",
    "- The largest revenue growth in the last month is observed in the categories ** “Cosmetics and accessories” **, ** “kitchen dishes” ** and ** “home textiles” **.\n",
    "- The outflow of revenue in the penultimate month was marked in ** “technique for beauty” ** and ** “products for children” **, which signals a possible reduction in interest in these categories.\n",
    "- Despite the growth in the current month, ** “Products for children” ** show weak stability - the revenue fluctuates on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "** The proposed measures: **\n",
    "- Configure personalized newsletters with content in your favorite categories.\n",
    "- divide customers into subgroups in sensitivity to shares:\n",
    "  - one - to offer benefits without shares,\n",
    "  - To others - use discounts, bonuses, cashback.\n",
    "- Add privileges for the most profitable customers: priority support, managerial line, early access to new products.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Business renewal: **\n",
    "- The loss of a client from this segment can lead to ** loss of 4-7 units of profit **.\n",
    "- Holding even ** 10% of customers ** from the segment can significantly increase ** LTV ** and reduce ** CAC **.\n",
    "- Clients of the segment have pronounced preferences, which facilitates targeting and personalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**  \n",
    "The segment A requires priority attention: due to high profits, significant outflow and potential to retain. A personalized approach and optimization of proposals will save customers and increase their value for business."
    "### General conclusion on the project\n",
    "#### Task\n",
    "The online store “In one click” set the task-to predict the likelihood of ** reducing the purchasing activity of regular customers ** to determine ** risk groups ** and offer ** personalized retention measures **.\n",
    "#### Data and Sources\n",
    "Four tables were provided:\n",
    "- `market_file.csv` - marketing, behavioral and categorical features.\n",
    "- `market_money.csv` - monthly revenue.\n",
    "- `market_time.csv` - the time spent on the site.\n",
    "- `money.csv` - the final profit from the client.\n",
    "#### data exposure\n",
    "- fixed typos in categorical features and names of periods.\n",
    "- Duplicates and gaps are checked and cleaned.\n",
    "- 3 clients with zero revenue in one of the months are excluded.\n",
    "- One extreme ejection on revenue is filtered.\n",
    "- The tables are combined by `ID`, the final dataset contains ** 1297 lines ** and ** 18 signs **.\n",
    "#### Research Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- Clients with reduced activity more often:\n",
    "  - less often agree to mailings,\n",
    "  - spend less time on the site,\n",
    "  - do less views and purchases,\n",
    "  - stronger depends on shares,\n",
    "  - They bring less revenue.\n",
    "- Correlations confirm: involvement (time, views, pages) reduces the risk of outflow.\n",
    "- Signs with the largest number of emissions: marketing activity and promotional purchases.\n",
    "- Signs are left as potentially informative for the model.\n",
    "### Model Training\n",
    "- 4 models are trained (`logisticregression`,` decisiontree`, `kneighbors`,` svc`) with two scaling methods (`standardscaler`,` minmaxscaler`).\n",
    "- Used by `RandomizedSearchcv`, metric - ** roc auc **.\n",
    "- ** The best model: ** `svc` with` minmaxscler`, roc auc = ** 0.9019 **.\n",
    "- High results also showed:\n",
    "  - `LogisticregResion` - ROC AUC = ** 0.9012 **\n",
    "  - `kneighborsclassifier` - ROC AUC = ** 0.8876 **\n",
    "#### interpretation of the model\n",
    "- For interpretation, `LogisticregResion` (transparent model) was used.\n",
    "- Shap indicators revealed that the most impact on the outflow has:\n",
    "  - `Pages_za_vizit`,` average_ -examination_kategoria_za_vizit` - indicators of involvement.\n",
    "  - `unpaid_products_Tuk_Cartal` and` promotional_ -purchases` - abandoned baskets and sensitivity to discounts.\n",
    "  - `Market_activ_6_Mes` and old revenues - traces of fatigue from communications.\n",
    "#### Customer segmentation\n",
    "Based on the probability of outflow, profit and behavioral signs, ** three segments **:\n",
    "- ** segment A ** - 185 clients: high profit (> 4.0) and high risk of outflow (> 0.7).\n",
    "  - * average profit: * 4.76  \n",
    "  - * The average probability of outflow: * 0.95  \n",
    "  - * Popular categories: * \"Products for children\", \"Cosmetics\", \"Home textile\"  \n",
    "  - * negative dynamics: * in the category \"Technique for Beauty\"\n",
    "- ** segment b ** - 80 clients: high share of promotional purchases (> 0.7), average profit (2–4).  \n",
    "  - Possible risk of discount dependence.  \n",
    "  - The fall in revenue in a number of categories has been noticed, especially \"goods for children\"\n",
    "- ** segment C ** - 132 clients: customers of the category \"Products forChildren ”with an increased risk of outflow (> 0.5).  \n",
    "  - unstable revenue, problems in the category: outdated assortment, ux, seasonality are possible\n",
    "#### Dynamics of revenue\n",
    "- In the segment a:\n",
    "  - the greatest decline in \"Technique for Beauty\" (the previous month is a sharp decrease).\n",
    "- In the segment b:\n",
    "  - Negative dynamics in “Products for children” and partially in “Technique”.\n",
    "- In the segment C:\n",
    "  - “Products for children” - weak stability, negative dynamics in the penultimate month.\n",
    "#### business recommendations\n",
    "** segment A ** - Priority retention:\n",
    "- personalize marketing in your favorite categories.\n",
    "- Add bonus programs, priority support, exclusive offers.\n",
    "- Do not use discounts - holding the price of service and privileges.\n",
    "** segment b ** - control of discount dependence:\n",
    "- Conduct A/B tests to reduce the number of shares.\n",
    "- Introduce alternative mechanics: cashback, cumulative points, privileges for loyalty.\n",
    "** segment C ** - Analysis of the product category:\n",
    "- Conduct UX assessment and study of usability on the site.\n",
    "- To double -check the assortment and seasonality in “Products for children”.\n",
    "- Collect feedback - find out what is the reason for a decrease in interest."
    "### comment on the recommendations:\n",
    "Segment A - priority retention\n",
    "Why is it highlighted:\n",
    "These are customers with high profit and high probability of outflow. Their loss will be the most painful for business, so the retention of this group is the main priority.\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "Personalized proposals:\n",
    "Supporting interest in purchases through targeted campaigns in your favorite categories (“goods for children”, “cosmetics”, etc.) - to increase involvement without reducing prices.\n",
    "Bonus programs / Priority service:\n",
    "Since the segment is loyal and brings profit, it is logical to strengthen emotional binding through intangible advantages - for example, priority in delivery, access to new collections, and the allocated manager.\n",
    "Do not use discounts:\n",
    "These clients are already buying at the “full price”, and are not prone to promotional offers - discounts will be ineffective and reduce the margin.\n",
    "Segment b - control of discount dependence\n",
    "Why is it highlighted:\n",
    "These clients make a lot of purchases for shares, while bringing not the highest profit. There is a risk that they are used to discounts and do not buy without them.\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "A/b test to restrict discounts:\n",
    "Check how such customers will react to the lack of shares. Perhaps they will continue to buy without discounts, and then it will be possible to improve margin.\n",
    "Transition to other benefits:\n",
    "Instead of constant discounts - bonuses, accumulative systems, or suggestions on recommendations. This reduces the dependence on the promo and teaches the client to another type of value.\n",
    "Segment C-commodity and ux analysis\n",
    "Why is it highlighted:\n",
    "These clients have the main interest - the category of \"goods for children.\" At the same time, they demonstrate a high risk of outflow. The analysis showed the negative dynamics of revenue in this category.\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "Checking a product assortment:\n",
    "There is a chance that the product is out of place, it does not correspond to expectations, or it got worse. This requires a review.\n",
    "Feedback collection:\n",
    "It is recommended to conduct a small study among this group to find out the causes of care.\n",
    "Analysis UX and windows:\n",
    "Perhaps problems are not in goods, but in their view: filters, description, photo, positioning. This is also worth checking before investments in the purchase."
